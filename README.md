1. Ensure youre using Visal Studio 2017 or a later version.
2.	The project requires the .Net framework and I think any version works
3.	To compile and run the application
•	First open Visual Studio
•	Open the Project by click on the file
•	Locate to the directory where ‘poe progs 3.sln’ is located then select the file to open it
•	This will take you  to Visual studio where you will be able to view the code. 
•	Click on the start button (with a green arrow) to run the app.

•	Additionally the solution file references a project file located at ‘poe progs3/poe progs 3.csproj’.  This project file contains the configurations and the files needed for the application.
